                        Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Nafshiyat Nihal. I am a senior at Michigan
                        State University studying computer science. I started off as a mechanical engineering major
                        during my first year, but I found my love for computer science after self-teaching Java over
                        a summer.
                    <p>
                    <p>
                        I like working out, playing guitar, and playing videogames. I taught myself guitar through
                        YouTube and reading guitar tablature. Playing guitar is one of my favorite hobbies because
                        it helps me destress from coding all day. Currently, I don't play many videogames due to not
                        having enough free time, but I used to play a lot of Call of Duty, Old School Runescape, and
                        Valorant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the future, I hope to work as a software / data engineer at a FAANG company, but that is not
                        my final goal. When I gain more experience, I want to use my knowledge to start a business in the
                        tech industry that helps people in some way. I want to make an impact on the world, not by being
                        "great" and "successful", but by helping others, and I think I can find a way to do that in my
                        profession.
